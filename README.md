# CommutingFirm
This program supports a consulting firm that offers commuting services around the metro area. The firm charges clients by the hour, and employees occasionally need to visit a client’s location. To do so, they have the choice of driving their own car, taking a taxi, or another ride-sharing service. 

A primary client wants a weekly report of each consultant’s billable hours, and any travel payments earnt each week 
(such as Personal Car Mileage or Ride Services). Each billable item tracks the employee to whom it associates with, 
and the day of the week on which the charge was earned. Billable hours are the number of hours worked by the employee, 
plus their hourly rate. 

The user is prompted to select from a menu. After fully completing the selected action from the menu item, the user 
is prompted to select another menu item. This continues until the user has selected to exit the program. The program 
displays a menu to the user with the following options:

   1.	Add a Billable Item
   2.	Display all Billable Items
   3.	Display the Total for Billable Service (no travel)
   4.	Display Employees who have carpooled (drivers included)
   5.	Quit
   
Based on the user’s selection, the program proceeds to perform accordingly. 

‘Add a Billable Item’ prompts the user to select from three services: Personal Car Mileage, Ride Service, or 
Service Hours. Then, the user enters the information correspondingly. 

‘Display all Billable Items’ displays all the billable items entered by the user as a well-formatted report.

‘Display the Total for Billable Service (no travel)’ displays the total of all the employees’ billable hours (not 
including travel expenses).

‘Display Employees who have carpooled (drivers included)’ displays all the names of the drivers and the employees who 
have carpooled. 

The inputs will be: 
   -	Employee’s general information: 
      o	Employee’s name
      o	Employee’s billing rate
      o	The day of the week the employee worked
      
   -	Personal Car information: 
      o	# of miles the employee drove
      o	Number of additional employees
      o	Names of additional employees 
      
   -	Ride Service information:
      o	Ride service name
      o	Ride service cost 
      
   -	Service Hours information: 
      o	# of employee’s worked hours 
      
The output will be displayed according to the selection from the menu; either a report of all billable items, 
the total cost of billable service, or names of drivers and employees who carpooled.
